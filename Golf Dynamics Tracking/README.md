Project Description: This was a project I made while studying Probabilistic Estimation and Tracking in Aerospace Engineering. My roommates and I had just started playing golf, and I had always wondered how they tracked where our balls landed. The local driving range seemed to have pretty inaccurate estimations of where our balls landed on certain hits, and so I set out to study this process. 

Study Focus: Using Extended Kalman Filtering to emulate the performance of advanced golf tracking systems and testing the systems sensitivity to the availability of measurements with 5 seperate cases. 

In this repo you will find: 
  
  Case 1: The case in which the tracker receives an updated measurement at every instant of time. 
  
  Case 2: The case in which the tracker receives an updated measurement every 0.01 seconds (100 FPS). 
  
  Case 3: The case in which the tracker receives an updated measurement every 0.1 seconds (10 FPS). 
  
  Case 4: The case in which a measurement is recorded continuously for only the first second of flight. 
 
  Case 5: The case in which a measurement is recorded every 0.01 seconds (100 FPS) for only the first second of flight. 
 
  Functions: Functions used repeatedly in the formulation of the results.
